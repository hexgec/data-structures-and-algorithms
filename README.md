# data-structures-and-algorithms

Within the code in this repository, a deterministic finite state automaton is implemented. The depth of the automaton is computed as well as minimisation algorithms being implemented. The automaton be used in a practical example to parse through strings and trigly connected components are found using Tarjanâ€™s algorithm.
